JavaScript’s object system uses prototypal inheritance.

When you create an instance of an object from a constructor, 
  the instance has its own customized properties and a copy of the methods in the constructor.

If you add properties to a constructor’s prototype, 
  all instances created from that constructor inherit those properties.

Putting properties in a prototype can reduce runtime code duplication in objects.

To override properties in the prototype, simply add the property to an instance.

A constructor function comes with a default prototype 
  that you can access with the function’s prototype property.

You can assign your own object to the prototype property of a constructor function.

If you use your own prototype object, make sure you set the constructor 
  function correctly to the constructor property for consistency.

If you add properties to a prototype after you’ve created instances 
  that inherit from it, all the instances will immediately inherit the new properties.

Use the hasOwnProperty method on an instance to 
  find out if a property is defined in the instance.

The method call can be used to invoke a function and 
  specify the object to be used as this in the body of the function.

Object is the object that all prototypes and instances ultimately inherit from.

Object has properties and methods that all objects inherit, like toString and hasOwnProperty.

You can override or add properties to builtin objects like Object and String, 
  but take care when doing so as your changes can have far-ranging effects.

In JavaScript, almost everything is an object, 
  including functions, arrays, many built-in objects, and all the custom objects you make yourself.

The delete operator can be used to remove a property from an object

# About functions:
###################################
Function declarations are evaluated before the rest of the code is evaluated.
Function expressions get evaluated later, with the rest of the code.
A function declaration doesn’t return a reference to a function; 
   rather it creates a variable with the name of the function and assigns the new function to it.
A function expression returns a reference to the new function created by the expression.
The process of invoking a function created by a declaration is exactly the same for one created with an expression.
You can hold function references in variables.

In other words:
Function declarations are statements; function expressions are used in statements.

1. Function expression vs. function declaration.
  var fe = function (tt) {...} # not parsed.
  function fd(tt) {...} # parsed on page load.

When the browser parses your page—before it evaluates any code—it’s 
looking for function declarations. When the browser finds one, 
it creates a function and assigns the resulting reference to a variable with the same name as the function.

  1. assign variables.
  2. evaluate functions.
  3. run code.

2. Functions are values, first class values. You can:
  a. assign a function to a variable.
  b. pass functions to functions.
  c. return functions from functions.
  
3. call vs. apply:
  Pretty much the same: apply comes in - the second argument needs to be an array, 
      which is unpacked into arguments that are passed to the called function.

# About Prototype:
###################################
1. Not only to reuse the code, but to occupy single block of memory.
2. Here’s the key: 
      the first time we get the value of sitting, we’re getting it from the prototype. 
      But then when we set sitting to true, that happens in the object instance, not the prototype.
    To check:
      .hasOwnProperty("...");

###################################
# About arrays:
###################################
Arrays come with sort method, with optional compare function as a parameter.

And of course, to use the compareSold function to sort the products array, we simply call the products array’s sort method:

var numArray = [21, 23, 1, 2];
numArray.sort(compareNumbers);

function compareNumbers(num1, num2) {
    if (num1 > num2) {
        return 1;
    } else if (num1 === num2) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}

function compareNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 - num2;
}

# Pencil exercise 1:
###################################
create a variable named discount and set its value to 10.
create a variable named total and set its value to be the result of price minus price times discount percentage.
check if price is greater than 25, it is, run freeShipping() function.

create a variable named count and set its value to 10;
run juggle() and subtract 1 from count while count is greater than 0

create an object dog with attributes of "name" and "weight", set name to "Rover" and weight to 35.
if dog's weight is greater than 30 display "WOOF WOOF".
if dog's weight is not greater than 30 display "woof woof"

create a variable named circleRadius with value of 20.
create a variable named circleAre with value of PI * (circleRadius squared)

3.9. Global Abatement

JavaScript makes it easy to define global variables that can hold all of the assets of your application. Unfortunately, global variables weaken the resiliency of programs and should be avoided.

One way to minimize the use of global variables is to create a single global variable for your application:

var MYAPP = {};

That variable then becomes the container for your application:

MYAPP.stooge = {
    "first-name": "Joe",
    "last-name": "Howard"
};

MYAPP.flight = {
    airline: "Oceanic",
    number: 815,
    departure: {
        IATA: "SYD",
        time: "2004-09-22 14:55",
        city: "Sydney"
    },
    arrival: {
        IATA: "LAX",
        time: "2004-09-23 10:42",
        city: "Los Angeles"
    }
};

By reducing your global footprint to a single name, you significantly reduce the chance of bad interactions with other applications, widgets, or libraries. Your program also becomes easier to read because it is obvious that MYAPP.stooge refers to a top-level structure. In the next chapter, we will see ways to use closure for information hiding, which is another effective global abatement technique.


///////////////////////////////
4.6. Exceptions

JavaScript provides an exception handling mechanism. Exceptions are unusual (but not completely unexpected) mishaps that interfere with the normal flow of a program. When such a mishap is detected, your program should throw an exception:

var add = function (a, b) {
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        throw {
            name: 'TypeError',
            message: 'add needs numbers'
        };
    }
    return a + b;
}

The throw statement interrupts execution of the function. It should be given an exception object containing a name property that identifies the type of the exception, and a descriptive message property. You can also add other properties.

The exception object will be delivered to the catch clause of a try statement:

// Make a try_it function that calls the new add
// function incorrectly.

var try_it = function (  ) {
    try {
        add("seven");
    } catch (e) {
        document.writeln(e.name + ': ' + e.message);
    }
}

try_it(  );
